# IntersectLine2D

The code is written by Majid Masoumi @ dr.majid.masoumi@gmail.com

Finding intersection points between two lines L1 and L2

The code does the following:

1- Writing a function that takes two 2D points (x0, y0), (x1, y1) as input arguments and returns the parameters a and b of the equation of the line passing through these two points assuming the equation has the form y = ax + b.

2â€“ Writing a function which returns the intersection point of two lines in 2D.
